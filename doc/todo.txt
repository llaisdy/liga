* liga todo

- escripts for building model, updating etc <- good idea

** dev tests

*** get_likely
- use? test? keep?
- keep - and write up caveats

*** dialyser
- keep up to date

** performance tests
- nb these are not "dev" tests

*** tromp_test
Get training and test data from the Tromp dataset; generate model; test model with test data

Make sure liga performs similarly to the Tromp original

*** regression_test
test a model against test_data_erl

Make sure performance has not deteriorated

*** extra diff test
Results without & with extra breadth weighting (what shall we call it?)

Use Tromp dataset, and a dataset with lots of language-unique accentation

** documentation

write it.

** Chinese tests

What is LIGA like with Chinese data: different dialects, different regions?
