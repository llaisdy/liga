* Language Identification: a Graph-based Approach

This is an implementation of the LIGA algorithm for language identification [1,2].

n.b.: at time of writing (August 2014), there is no other open-source implementation of this algorithm.

** Usage

The modules in scripts/ and test/ give examples of usage.

** Calibration

As well as units tests in test/, a replication of the calibration in [2] is descibed in calibration/calibration.org.
